looking at the fact that you ended up here, youre probably as desperate as me to find a good and updated terminator plugin for minecraft.
well i might ad more features in this for, maybe not.
i just made this fork to make it easier for me to find the fork.
this is a fork of a fork so check out the original author
enjoy your stay:)

list of commands that the previous author added:
so theres the normal terminator add, clear, summoner, remove summoner but theres also some other that the author included
which includes the terminator ignore {player}
also the author added things like water bucket clucthing or better swimming
